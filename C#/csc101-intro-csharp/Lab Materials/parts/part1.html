			This exercise takes you through the entire process of building and running a C# program using
			<strong>Visual Studio</strong>. The C# code will be very simple. Most of your time will be
			spent creating a project, compiling it into an executable program, and running it to test
			your work. The overall steps are listed below:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Create a new Console application.</li>
			<li>Write a custom message to the Console window.</li>
			<li>Build and run the program.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			Below is the output from the finished application.

		<h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>

		<p>
			Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
		</p>

		<h2>Create a new Console application</h2>
		<p>
			You will use <strong>Visual Studio</strong> to create an application. <strong>Visual Studio</strong>
			is an <strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</strong> which means it has all the tools
			you need to write, build, and run your program.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Start <strong>Visual Studio</strong>. You should see something similar to the image shown below.	
			</li>

			<li>
				Create a new <strong>Project</strong>. Select <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project</strong> menu entry (see below).
			<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part1.VS_NewSolutionMenu.png" width =" " alt="" /></li>

			<li>
				In the <strong> New Project</strong> dialog, click  <strong> Visual C# &gt; Windows Classic Desktop &gt; Console App </strong>, you can also type console in the search bar and have Visual Studio find the appropriate template.
				<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part1.VS_Console.png" width = "" alt= ""/>
            If you are using Visual Studio for Mac, click the <strong>new project</strong> button on the start screen and select <strong> .NET Core &gt; Console Application </strong> and then click <strong> next </strong> <img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part1.VS-Mac_NewProject.png"  alt=""/> </li>

			<li>
				
				A Console project interacts with the user through a text-based window. It does not have a
				Graphical User Interface (GUI) with buttons and text-input areas but it is a great way to get started
			as a programmer since it requires very little code to get an application running. </li>
			<li>Enter <strong>HelloWorld</strong> in the <strong> Name</strong> field. The <strong>Name</strong>
				field determines the name of the <strong>Project</strong>. 
			</li>
				
			<li>
				Notice how the <strong>Solution name</strong> field gets filled in automatically to match the project name. A <em>Solution</em>
				is a container that can hold multiple projects. For example, you could have a single solution with both your Android and iOS
				projects inside it. For solutions that contain only a single project, it makes sense for the project name and the solution name to match.
			</li>

			<li>
				In the <strong>Location</strong> field, enter the folder where you would like to store your work.
			</li>

			<li>
			When you have everything filled in, click <strong>OK.</strong></li>

			<li>
				Visual Studio will create the Solution, the Project, and some starter C# code for you (see below).
			  <img src="./res/images/Part1.VS_StarterSolution.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -"  class="indent-none" />
			</li>

		</ol>

		<h2>Write a custom message to the Console window</h2>
		<p>
			Visual Studio adds some convenient starter code for you when you create a new project.
			In this part, you will spend a few minutes working with Visual Studio to examine this
			starter code. You will then modify the code so it prints your custom message.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Visual Studio makes it easy to work with your code. The Solution view along the left edge
				shows you your entire Solution. The text editor in the central area lets you modify the contents
				of your files. The image below shows these two key areas.
				<img src="./res/images/Part1.VS_Parts.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" class="indent-none" />
			</li>

			<li>
				Visual Studio puts the starter code in a file named <strong>Program.cs</strong>. The code in the file is called
				<em>source code</em> and the file is called a <em>source file</em>. C# source files have a <strong>.cs</strong>
				extension. The Solution view lists the <strong>Program.cs</strong> file (see below).
				<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part1.VS_SolutionView.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
			</li>

			<li>
				The <strong>Program.cs</strong> file should already be open in the text editor. If it is not, double-click
				on it in the Solution view to open it.
			</li>

			<li>
				Your C# program can make use of an extensive <strong>Standard Library</strong> that provides pre-written
				pieces of code that you can call on to help you get your work done. For example, there are routines to
				compute square root, search within text, read from a file on disk, etc. The library is divided into
				<em>namespaces</em> where a namespace is a group of related code. The most common namespace is
				<code>System</code>. If your program needs to use something from <code>System</code>, you place the
				line of code shown below at the top of your source file. Your code will need to use the <code>Console</code>
				class that is part of the <code>System</code> namespace so it should contain the line of code shown below.
<pre class="prettyprint">
using System;
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				You should put all of your own code inside one of your own namespaces (see below).
				Most programmers use their company name as part of their namespace name to keep their code
				clearly labeled and distinct from third-party code that they might incorporate into their
				projects. Using a namespace is not technically required but it is considered a best practice.
<pre class="prettyprint">
namespace HelloWorld
{
  ...
}
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Inside your namespace, Visual Studio created a class named <code>MainClass</code> (see below).
				For now, we can define a class informally as a group of related methods. 
				<pre class="prettyprint">
class MainClass
{
  ...
}
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Inside <code>MainClass</code>, Visual Studio created a method named <code>Main</code> (see below).
				A <em>method</em> is a sequence of program instructions with a name. Other programming languages
				use the terms <em>function</em>, <em>procedure</em>, or <em>subroutine</em> for this concept.
				The <code>Main</code> method is the program <em>entry point</em>; that is, it runs automatically
				when the program is started. The program automatically shuts down when <code>Main</code> completes
				execution. The C# language defines very precise rules for how <code>Main</code> must be written;
				for example, the modifiers <code>public</code> and <code>static</code> are required, the name
				must be <code>Main</code> with an upper-case <code>M</code>, etc.
                <pre class="prettyprint">
class MainClass
{
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Inside <code>Main</code> there should be a call to <code>Console.WriteLine</code> method (see below).
				<code>Console</code> is a class and <code>WriteLine</code> is a method defined inside it.
				You use <code>WriteLine</code> to print something to the Console window (remember
				that our project type is <strong>Console Project</strong> so the user will see a
				Console window automatically when the program runs).
<pre class="prettyprint">
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Change the <code>"Hello World!"</code> text so the program will print a message of your choice.
			</li>

		</ol>

		<h2>Build and run the program</h2>

		<p>
			In order to test your program, you must first build an <em>executable</em> file from your source code. 
			The precise term for this process is <em>build</em>. The <em>compiler</em> performs the key part of the build
			process since it translates the source code you wrote into the machine code that the CPU can understand. 
			For our simple program, compilation is the main step of the build process. Other projects such as
			Android or iOS apps have complicated build processes that require steps such as code generation or the
			packaging multiple files into a single archive.
		</p>

		<ol>

			<li>
				To build your project, click on the <strong>Build &gt; Build Solution</strong> menu entry in Visual Studio (see below).
				<img src="./res/images/Part1.VS_Build_1.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" width="" class="indent-none" />
			</li>

			<li>
				If your program is correct, you should see the message <strong>Build succeded</strong>  message in the output window at the bottom of the screen.
			</li>

			<li>
				If your program has an error, Visual Studio will show you the line that has the problem along with a
				short description of the issue (see below). Examine the indicated line, fix the problem, and try to
				build again.
				<img src="./res/images/Part1.VS_Error.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -"  class="indent-none" />
			</li>

			<li>
				To run your program, click on the <strong>Debug &gt; Start Without Debugging</strong> menu entry (see below).
				<img src="./res/images/Part1.VS_Build_3.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -"  class="indent-none" />
			</li>

			<li>
				A Console window should appear on your screen and display the message you passed to <code>Console.WriteLine</code>
				as shown below.
				<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part1.Completed.png" width="" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
			</li>

		</ol>
