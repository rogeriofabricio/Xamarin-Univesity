			In this exercise, you will build a C# program that uses a person's age and the standard
			retirement age to calculate how many years they have left before retirement. The program
			will let you practice using variables and performing mathematical calculations. Here are
			the key tasks that you will be coding:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Declare integer variables to hold ages and years-to-retirement.</li>
			<li>Create a symbolic constant for the standard retirement age.</li>
			<li>Declare a string variable to store a message.</li>
			<li>Calculate years-to-retirement.</li>
			<li>Output a message and the calculated values to the Console.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Below is the output from the finished application.

		<h1 id="steps">Steps</h1>

		<p>
			Below are the step-by-step instructions to implement the exercise.
		</p>

		<h2>Create a new Console application</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Start <strong>Visual Studio</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Create a new <strong>Console Project</strong> using either the <strong>New Project...</strong> link on the home screen
				or the <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Project</strong> menu entry.
			</li>

			<li>
				Name the Project and Solution <strong>Fundamentals</strong>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Fill in the <strong>Location</strong> field with the name of the folder where you would like to store your work.
			</li>

			<li>
				Click <strong>OK</strong>.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Implement your program</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				The file <strong>Program.cs</strong> should already be open in the text editor. If it is not, open it
				by double-clicking on the filename in the Solution view.
			</li>

			<li>
				Please delete the <code>Console.WriteLine</code> line that Visual Studio generated inside <code>Main</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				All your code will be written inside the curly braces that delimit <code>Main</code>.
				Position the cursor in the text-editor window on the line below the open-curly-brace for
				<code>Main</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Declare two integer variables to hold the ages for two different people. Name the variables
				<code>yourAge</code> and <code>myAge</code>. To get you started, code for the first variable is
				shown below; notice how it includes the type (<code>int</code>), a name (<code>yourAge</code>),
				and an initial value (the <code>= 35</code> part). It also has a semicolon to mark the end
				of the statement.
<pre class="prettyprint">
int yourAge = 35;
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Declare an integer constant named <code>retirement</code> and initialize it to the typical retirement age
				in your country (e.g. 65). The code will be the same as declaring a regular variable except that it
				will have the word <code>const</code> at the beginning. A variable that includes the word <code>const</code>
				is not allowed to change its value; that is, it always keeps the value you put in when you declare it.
			</li>

			<li>
				Declare a <code>string</code> variable named <code>message</code> and initialize it to
				<code>"Will we be ready to retire soon?"</code>.
			</li>

			<li>
				An equals sign is called the <em>assignment operator</em> and you use it to load a new value
				into an existing variable. Assignment is very similar to initialization: the difference
				is that initialization happens once when you first declare a variable while assignment happens
				afterward and can occur as many times as you need (see below). In your program, use assignment
				to change the <code>myAge</code> variable to a different value.
<pre class="prettyprint">
int x = 3; // initialization
x = 4; // assignment
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Calculate the number of years until retirement for both people (i.e. <code>yourAge</code> and
				<code>myAge</code>). Do this by subtracting the age from the <code>retirement</code>
				variable. Store the results in variables named <code>yearsToRetirementForYou</code> and
				<code>yearsToRetirementForMe</code>. The code below shows how to perform subtraction;
				you can adapt it for use in the retirement-age code.
<pre class="prettyprint">
int x = 3;
int y = 4;
int difference = y - x;
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				Use <code>Console.WriteLine</code> to print out the value of the <code>message</code> variable.
				The code below shows how to print variables; you can adapt it to print the value of <code>message</code>.
<pre class="prettyprint">
int x = 3;
Console.WriteLine(x);

string s = "hello";
Console.WriteLine(s);
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>
				The next goal is to print text similar to that shown below. Notice how it starts with the
				string "Years for you: " and then ends with the value of the <code>yearsToRetirementForYou</code>
				variable.
				<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part2.StringOutput1.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
				You could do this using two print statements as shown below. Notice how the first one uses
				<code>Console.Write</code> (not <code>Console.WriteLine</code>) so the two parts end up on
				the same output line. This shows the difference between <code>Console.Write</code> and
				<code>Console.WriteLine</code>, the "<code>Line</code>" in the name indicates it adds a
				newline character to the output automatically.
<pre class="prettyprint">
Console.Write("Years for you: ");
Console.WriteLine(yearsToRetirementForYou);
</pre>
				A more elegant solution is to use a single <code>Console.WriteLine</code> to print both values.
				One way to do this string <em>concatenation</em> (i.e. joining together) to create a single
				value to pass to <code>Console.WriteLine</code>. The code below shows this technique. The
				<code>+</code> sign means concatenation here because one of the operands is a string; whenever
				there is a string involved <em>+</em> means concatenation.
<pre class="prettyprint">
Console.WriteLine("Years for you: " + yearsToRetirementForYou);
</pre>
Add the line of code above to your program.
			</li>

			<li>
				The final goal is to print text similar to that shown below. It starts with the string "Years for me: "
				and ends with the value of the <code>yearsToRetirementForMe</code> variable.
				<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part2.StringOutput2.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
				
				The goal here is basically the same as the previous step; however, we will use this as a chance
				to introduce the idea of <em>string formatting</em>. This will give us an alternate way to 
				produce the desired output from a single line of code. Please look at the code shown below.
				The first thing we pass to <code>Console.WriteLine</code> is called the <em>format string</em>
				(<code>"Hello {0} you earn {1}"</code>). The curly braces are placeholders that get replaced
				with the value of one of the other things we are passing: <code>{0}</code> will be replaced
				by the value of <code>name</code> while <code>{1}</code> will be replaced by the value of
				<code>salary</code>. C# often starts counting at 0, so <code>{0}</code> specifies the first
				parameter after the format string, <code>{1}</code> specifies the second, and so on.
				The output will be <code>Hello Jesse you earn 12345</code>.
<pre class="prettyprint">
string name = "Jesse";
int salary = 12345;
Console.WriteLine("Hello {0} you earn {1}", name, salary);
</pre>
				Use this idea to print the string "Years for me: " followed by the value of the
				<code>yearsToRetirementForMe</code> variable.
			</li>

			<li>
				Run your program by clicking on the <strong>Run &gt; Start Without Debugging</strong> menu entry
				(clicking on <strong>Start Without Debugging</strong> actual does three things: saves your work,
				builds your project, and runs your program).
				A Console window should appear on your screen and display the program output as shown below.
				<img class="indent-none" src="./res/images/Part2.Completed.png" alt="- - - - - - - - - MISSING IMAGE - - - - - - - - - -" />
			</li>

		</ol>

		<h1>Summary</h1>
		In this lab, you saw how to declare variables, perform basic math, and produce formatted output.
		This program was still quite simple but it should start to give you a hint of the power of
		programming. For example, we only need to add the ability to read user input to make this
		program useful to calculate the years-to-retirement for anyone that runs it.
