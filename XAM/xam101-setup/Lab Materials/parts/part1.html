        <p>15 minutes</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            In this exercise we will build and run the provided <b>Tasky Pro</b> application. 
            This will ensure you have your development environment setup properly and prepare you for your Xamarin University education.
        </p>

        <p>
        TaskyPro is a cross-platform todo/task application sample that allows you to track "ToDo" items. 
        It illustrates cross-platform code-sharing for the data and business logic layers and separates out the User Interface and Application Layer into appropriate platform-specific applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Assets</h2>
        <p>
            The provided <strong>Exercise 1</strong> folder contains a subfolder named <strong>TaskyPro</strong> with the solution you will need to complete this lab exercise. 
        </p>

        <h2>Running the application</h2>
        <p>
            When executing the app, you can test on a real device, or on the emulator / simulator.
